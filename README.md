# Mini UGC Platform

This project is a User-Generated Content (UGC) Platform built as part of a technical assessment task. It allows users to upload, view, and manage video content in an OTT-style layout. The platform is built using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Supabase** for backend functionalities, including user authentication, database operations, and file storage.

## Features

### Core Features

#### User Authentication:
- **Sign Up/Login**: Users can sign up and log in using either Email Provider or Google OAuth via Supabase authentication.
  
#### Access Control:
- **Unauthenticated users** can view all uploaded videos but cannot upload or perform any CRUD operations on videos.
- **Authenticated users** can upload videos and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their uploaded content.

#### Content Uploading:
- **Authenticated users** can upload videos with a title and description.
- **Validations**:
  - Title and description fields must not be empty.
  - Video file size is limited to 10 MB.
- **On submission**:
  - The video is uploaded to **Supabase Storage**.
  - Metadata (title, description, file URL) is saved in the **Supabase Database**.
  - Toast notifications are used to show messages (e.g., "Video successfully uploaded").

#### Content Display (Homepage):
- A grid layout showcasing all uploaded videos.
- Each item displays:
  - A thumbnail preview of the video.
  - Title and description.
- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile screens.
- Users can search videos by title using a search bar at the top of the homepage.
- Real-time filtering occurs as the user types.

#### Detail Page:
- Clicking on any video redirects to a detailed page displaying:
  - The full-size video.
  - Title and description.

#### CRUD Operations for Authenticated Users:
- **Authenticated users** can update or delete videos they have uploaded.
  - Videos can be edited by changing the title, description, or replacing the video file.
  - Videos can be deleted from both the storage and the database.

#### APIs:
- **POST `/api/upload-content`**: Upload video metadata to the Supabase database.
- **GET `/api/fetch-content`**: Retrieve all video metadata from the database.
- **GET `/api/search-content`**: Fetch videos matching the search query.
- **PUT `/api/update-content`**: Update video metadata for authenticated users.
- **DELETE `/api/delete-content`**: Delete video metadata and associated storage for authenticated users.

#### Supabase Integration:
- **Database**:
  - Table: `Content`
  - Columns: `id`, `title`, `description`, `file_url`, `created_at`.
- **Storage**:
  - Videos are stored in a **Supabase storage** bucket.
  - File URLs are saved in the database for retrieval.
- **Authentication**:
  - Utilizes **Supabaseâ€™s Email & Password** and **Google OAuth** providers for user authentication.
  - Tokens are used to authenticate users and allow access to restricted features.

### Optional Features (Implemented)

- **Loading Spinner**: Shows a spinner during file uploads or while fetching data.
- **Pagination**: Displays content in manageable chunks for large datasets.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Displays user-friendly error messages for validation failures or backend issues.
  - Robust handling of edge cases like invalid file uploads, empty search results, and failed authentication attempts.
- **Toast Notifications**: Users receive toast messages for actions like successfully uploading a video, successfully updating a video, or encountering errors.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**:
  - Designed with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive interface.
  - Smooth page transitions with animations.
